# Proxmox API Credentials (use one of the following methods)

# Method 1: Password-based authentication
# PROXMOX_HOST="your-proxmox-host-or-ip"
# PROXMOX_USER="your-username@pam" # or @pve, etc.
# PROXMOX_PASSWORD="your_password"

# Method 2: API Token-based authentication
# PROXMOX_HOST="your-proxmox-host-or-ip"
# PROXMOX_USER="your-username@pam" # The user associated with the token
# PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_ID="your_token_id" # e.g., k3sdeploy@pve!mytoken
# PROXMOX_API_TOKEN_SECRET="your_api_token_secret_value"

# Note: 
# - Uncomment and fill in the details for your chosen method.
# - If using API token, PROXMOX_USER is still needed if your token ID doesn't include the full user specifier (user@realm).
# - You can also specify these directly in config.json, but using .env for secrets is recommended.
# - If a value is present in both .env and config.json (without ENV: prefix), 
#   the .env value will take precedence if loaded by python-dotenv with override=True.
# - If using the "ENV:VAR_NAME" syntax in config.json, the corresponding environment
#   variable (e.g., VAR_NAME) must be set here or in your system environment.
